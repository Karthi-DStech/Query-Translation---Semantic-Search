# RAG-Query-Translation--Semantic-Search

This repository contains code for performing Query Translation techniques in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). 

Query translation techniques enhance semantic search by transforming user queries to better match their intent and context with relevant documents. These techniques collectively improve search accuracy by ensuring the query aligns more closely with the diverse ways information is presented in documents.


**The code processes documents from a given URL, splits and indexes them, and then uses different retrieval methods to answer queries.**
